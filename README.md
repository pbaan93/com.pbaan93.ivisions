# iVisions

Control your iVisions projection screen or projector lift with Homey! 
This app allows you to connect to any iVisions product fitted with the iViConnect system (all motorized projection screen series and projector lifts, for more information: [www.i-visions.com](http://www.i-visions.com)). It works with RF and will function even if there is no line of sight between your Homey device and iVisions product.
